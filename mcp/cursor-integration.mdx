# Adding camelAI to Cursor

Integrate camelAI directly into Cursor to access powerful data analysis capabilities without leaving your development environment. Query your databases, generate insights, and get SQL results all within your code editor.

<Note>
For the latest official guidance from Cursor, see their Model Context Protocol documentation: [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).
</Note>

## Configuration

camelAI uses the SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport method for MCP integration, allowing for real-time communication between Cursor and our servers.

### Step 1: Create MCP Configuration

Create an MCP configuration file in one of these locations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Global">
    Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory for access across all projects:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.cursor
    touch ~/.cursor/mcp.json
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project-Specific">
    Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project directory for project-specific access:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .cursor
    touch .cursor/mcp.json
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Configure the Server

Add the following configuration to your `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "camelai": {
      "url": "https://app.camelai.com/mcp",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key from [app.camelai.com/api-keys](https://app.camelai.com/api-keys/).
</Warning>

After saving your configuration file, restart Cursor to load the MCP server connection.

## Using camelAI in Cursor

Once configured, camelAI tools will be automatically available in Cursor's Composer Agent.

### Tool Approval

By default, Cursor will ask for approval before running camelAI tools:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tool Request">
    When the Agent wants to query your data, it will display a tool approval request
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Parameters">
    Click the arrow next to the tool name to see what query will be executed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve or Deny">
    Choose whether to allow the tool to run based on the query parameters
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can enable auto-run mode in Cursor's settings to automatically approve camelAI tool usage without manual confirmation.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server Not Connecting">
    **Symptoms:** camelAI tools don't appear in Cursor's available tools

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your API key is correct
    - Check that `mcp.json` is in the correct location
    - Restart Cursor after configuration changes
    - Ensure you have internet connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    **Symptoms:** Tools appear but fail with authentication errors

    **Solutions:**
    - Generate a new API key at [app.camelai.com/api-keys](https://app.camelai.com/api-keys/)
    - Verify the API key is correctly set in the `env` section
    - Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timeout Issues">
    **Symptoms:** Tools time out when processing complex queries

    **Solutions:**
    - Break complex queries into smaller parts
    - Check your database connection performance
