## See It In Action

**Try camelAI yourself** - We've connected our agent to the entire Hacker News dataset so you can experience what your users will feel.

Try asking questions like:
- "What are the most discussed AI companies this year and how has sentiment changed over time?"
- "Show me the correlation between post timing and engagement for Show HN posts"

Watch as camelAI writes SQL in real-time, explores the data from multiple angles, and creates interactive visualizations - exactly what your users will experience with your data.
