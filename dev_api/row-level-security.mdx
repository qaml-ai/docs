Row Level Security (RLS) allows you to restrict which rows are visible to each user, based on their unique identifier (uid).

## How It Works

When a user interacts with Camel (for example, through an iframe or the API), Camel sets a session variable to the current `uid` for every query it runs. This variable can then be referenced in your database's RLS policies to filter data dynamically per user.

- **Supported Databases:**
  - ClickHouse
  - PostgreSQL
- **Other databases:** RLS is not yet supported, but may be added in the future.

## Setting the UID Variable

- **PostgreSQL:**
  - Camel sets the session variable `camel.uid` using `SET LOCAL camel.uid = '<uid>'` for each query.
- **ClickHouse:**
  - Camel sets the session setting `SQL_camel_uid` for each query.

You can use this variable in your RLS policies or views to restrict data access.

## Example: PostgreSQL RLS Policy

Suppose you have a table `orders` with a column `user_id`. You want each user to only see their own orders.

1. Enable RLS on the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

2. Create a policy using the `camel.uid` variable:

```sql
CREATE POLICY user_rls_policy ON orders
  USING (user_id::text = current_setting('camel.uid'));
```

- Here, `current_setting('camel.uid')` returns the current user's uid as set by Camel.

## Example: ClickHouse RLS Policy

ClickHouse supports native row policies that can use custom settings for dynamic, per-user or per-tenant isolation. You do not need to use views for RLSâ€”row policies are more robust and secure.

Suppose you have a table `orders` with a column `tenant_id`, and you want to restrict each user to only see their own tenant's data. You can use a custom setting (e.g., `SQL_camel_uid`) that Camel sets for each query.

1. Create a role and allow the custom setting:

```sql
CREATE ROLE readonly_role;
ALTER ROLE readonly_role SETTINGS SQL_camel_uid CHANGEABLE_IN_READONLY;
GRANT SELECT ON orders TO readonly_role;
```

2. Create a row policy using the custom setting:

```sql
CREATE ROW POLICY orders_rls_policy ON orders USING tenant_id = getSetting('SQL_camel_uid') TO readonly_role;
```

3. Create a user and assign the role:

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS readonly_user IDENTIFIED BY '' SETTINGS readonly = 1;
GRANT readonly_role TO readonly_user;
SET DEFAULT ROLE readonly_role TO readonly_user;
```

Now, when Camel queries ClickHouse, it automatically sets the `SQL_camel_uid` setting for the session. The row policy will enforce that only rows matching the user's uid (or tenant id) are visible.

**Security Benefits:**
- If the `SQL_camel_uid` setting is omitted, the query fails, preventing accidental data leaks.
- The setting is provided in the session context, not merged into the SQL, making it more resistant to SQL injection.
- You only need to ensure that queries do not allow overriding the setting in the SQL itself.

This approach is robust, scalable, and leverages ClickHouse's built-in security features for row-level access control.

## How to Use

- When embedding Camel iframes or using the API, always set a unique `uid` for each user.
- All queries run by Camel for that user will have the session variable set automatically.
- You can use this variable in your database RLS policies, views, or queries to restrict data access.

## Best Practices

- Always use a unique, stable identifier for each user as the `uid`.
- Test your RLS policies with different uids to ensure correct data isolation.
- Document your RLS logic for your team.

## Limitations

- RLS via session variable is only supported for ClickHouse and PostgreSQL at this time.
- Other databases do not support this feature yet.
- The session variable is only set for queries run through Camel.

## Troubleshooting

- If users see too much or too little data, double-check your RLS policy logic and that the `uid` is being set as expected.
- You can log or audit the value of the session variable in your database for debugging.
