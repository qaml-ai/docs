Every organization can mark one theme as its default. That default is automatically applied to any iframe that doesn't explicitly specify a theme.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Single Default" icon="star">
    Only one theme at a time can hold default status per organization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Application" icon="sparkles">
    Iframes without theme parameters inherit the current default
  </Card>
  <Card title="Override Hierarchy" icon="layer-group">
    Explicit theme parameters always win over the default
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy Switching" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Setting a new default instantly removes default status from the previous theme
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Changing the Default

When you designate a new default theme:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Previous Default Demoted">
    The previous default (if any) loses its default status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Immediate Application">
    All existing iframes relying on the old default immediately adopt the new default
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explicit Themes Preserved">
    Iframes that explicitly declared a theme keep using the theme they were built with
  </Step>
</Steps>
