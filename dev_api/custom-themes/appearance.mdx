## Theme Mode

Choose how camelAI handles light and dark themes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Light Only" icon="sun-bright">
    Force light mode for all users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dark Only" icon="moon">
    Force dark mode for all users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Both (Adaptive)" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    Automatically detect and match the user's system preference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## UI Color Theming

Customize the iframe appearance by providing four key colors:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Primary Background Color">
    Used as the primary background color for the chat app and artifact panel
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dark Background Color">
    Dark background color used for text input and side navigation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Light Background Color">
    Light background color used for artifact tags
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Outline Color">
    Outline color for borders, buttons, and interactive elements like recommendations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

These four colors make up the bulk of colors applied throughout the interface.

<Tip>
We recommend the backgrounds are different shades of the same color.
