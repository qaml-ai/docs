### Default Message

By default, camelAI displays: **Your data is connected. Ask me anything!**

### Customization

Replace the default with your own welcome message:

- **Character Limit**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Visibility**: Appears in every new chat session

### Examples

Here are some effective start messages for different use cases:

<CodeGroup>
```text General Discovery
What insights can I help you discover today?
```

```text Domain-Specific
Ask about sales, inventory, or customer trends
```

```text Time-Sensitive
Your Q4 metrics are ready to explore
```

```text Guidance-Focused
Start with 'Show me...' or 'What are...'
```
</CodeGroup>
