The Knowledge Base is a critical feature that enhances camelAI's ability to understand and analyze your data accurately. It provides context-specific information that helps camelAI deliver consistent, relevant insights tailored to your business domain.

## What is the Knowledge Base?

The knowledge base is a text area where you define important context about your data, business logic, and terminology. This information helps camelAI:

- Maintain consistent metric definitions across all queries
- Navigate complex schemas by understanding which tables to prioritize or avoid
- Interpret ambiguous column names and relationships
- Apply proper data formatting and display preferences
- Handle time periods and date calculations correctly
- Understand locale-specific requirements (currency, language, regional formats)

## Persistent vs Session-Specific Knowledge Base Entries

CamelAI supports two types of knowledge base entries, each designed for different use cases:

### Persistent (Stateful) Entries

Persistent entries are created through the `/api/v1/knowledge-base/` API endpoint and are tied to your connection IDs. These entries:

- Persist across all iframes that use the associated connection ID
- Apply globally to all users and sessions
- Are ideal for context that applies universally across your organization

Use persistent entries for:
- Dataset descriptions and schema information
- Company-wide terminology and metric definitions
- Standard table relationships and joins
- Data quality notes that affect all users

### Session-Specific (Stateless) Entries

Session-specific entries are provided directly in the iframe creation request via the `knowledge_base_entries` parameter. These entries:

- Only apply to that specific iframe instance
- Do not persist beyond the iframe's lifecycle
- Work alongside any persistent entries you've already created

Use session-specific entries for:
- User-specific instructions (e.g., "This user prefers non-technical explanations")
- Organization-specific context when serving multiple tenants
- Temporary overrides or custom behavior for specific sessions
- Locale preferences (e.g., "Please respond in Spanish")

### Example: Using Session-Specific Entries

When creating an iframe, you can include temporary knowledge base entries that apply only to that session:

```python
import requests

payload = {
    "uid": "<string>",
    "srcs": ["<string>"],
    "ttl": 900,
    "knowledge_base_entries": [
        "This user is new to the tool and has never used SQL before. Please keep answers non-technical",
        "Please speak in Spanish"
    ],
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "response_mode": "full",
    "show_sidebar": True
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.camelai.com/api/v1/iframe/create",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json=payload
)
```

These session-specific entries complement (not replace) any persistent knowledge base entries associated with your connection IDs.

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Include a Dataset Description

Every knowledge base should start with a clear description of what your dataset represents. This foundational context helps camelAI understand the overall purpose and structure of your data.

<CodeGroup>
```text Example
This dataset is a replica of our production e-commerce database. 
It contains customer orders, product inventory, and shipping information 
from our online retail platform serving the US market.
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Specify Standard Schemas

If your data follows a well-known schema or is a replica of a standard system, explicitly state this. camelAI can leverage its understanding of common schemas to provide better insights.

<Note>
**Examples of standard schemas to mention:**
- "This PostgreSQL database mirrors our Salesforce CRM data structure"
- "Our MySQL database follows the Shopify schema for e-commerce data"
- "This dataset implements the FHIR standard for healthcare records"
- "Our analytics tables follow the Google Analytics 4 event schema"
</Note>

### 3. Define Company-Specific Terminology

Document any terms that have specific meanings within your organization, especially when they differ from industry standards or could be ambiguous. 

<Warning>
We recommend using multiple focused entries to improve RAG performance.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```text Example
Entry 1: "Active User": A user who has logged in within the last 30 days AND completed at least one transaction
Entry 2: "LTV" (Lifetime Value): The sum of total_purchases + subscription_revenue + addon_revenue columns
Entry 3: "Churn": When a customer has no activity for 90+ days (not the standard 30-day definition)
Entry 4: "Region": Refers to our custom sales territories, not geographic regions (see regions_mapping table)
```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Clarify Complex Relationships

Help camelAI navigate joins and relationships by explaining non-obvious connections between tables.

<CodeGroup>
```text Example
Table Relationships:
- orders.user_id links to users.id (primary relationship)
- orders.promo_code links to both promotions.code AND partner_promotions.code
- product_variants should be used instead of products table for inventory queries
- Always join transactions through transaction_items, never directly to orders
```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Specify Data Preferences

Include preferences for how data should be formatted, calculated, or displayed.

<CodeGroup>
```text Example
Data Handling Preferences:
- When calculating percentages, round to 1 decimal place
- Week starts on Monday for all weekly aggregations
- Fiscal year begins April 1st
```
</CodeGroup>

### 6. Document Data Quality Issues

Be transparent about known data limitations or quality issues to prevent misleading analyses.

<CodeGroup>
```text Example
Data Quality Notes:
- Revenue data before March 2022 may be incomplete due to migration
- The user_demographics table has ~15% missing values for age field
- Avoid using the legacy_orders table - use orders_v2 instead
- Product categories were restructured in June 2023; use category_mapping for historical comparisons
```
</CodeGroup>

## Structuring Knowledge Base Entries

### Use Multiple Focused Entries

Due to RAG implementation, multiple smaller, focused entries perform better than one large entry. 

<Tabs>
<Tab title="✅ Good Practice">
```text
Entry 1: "Customer segments: Premium (>$1000/year), Standard ($100-999), Basic (<$100)"
Entry 2: "Subscription tiers: Starter ($29/mo), Professional ($99/mo), Enterprise (custom)"
Entry 3: "Geographic regions: NA (US/Canada), EU (European Union), APAC (Asia-Pacific)"
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="❌ Poor Practice">
```text
Customer and Business Context: Our customer segments include Premium customers who spend over $1000 per year, Standard customers who spend $100-999 annually,
and Basic customers under $100. We also have subscription tiers with Starter at $29/month, Professional at $99/month, and Enterprise with custom pricing. 
Our geographic regions cover NA which includes US and Canada, EU covering the European Union, and APAC for Asia-Pacific. Additionally, our fiscal year 
starts April 1st, we calculate LTV as total_purchases plus subscription_revenue plus addon_revenue, and active users must have logged in within 30 days AND
completed a transaction. Our churn definition is 90+ days of inactivity, and regions refer to sales territories not geographic areas.

## Managing Your Knowledge Base

You can create, read, update, and delete knowledge base entries through the API or through the developer console. Changes take effect immediately for all new conversations.
