## Required Software

### Docker
Docker is required to run camelAI and its dependencies. Install Docker by following the official installation guide for your operating system:

- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

After installation, verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
```

### Docker Compose
Docker Compose is used to manage camelAI's services. It's included with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac. For Linux, you'll need to install it separately:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
docker compose version
```

## Network Requirements

- Port 8000 available for the web interface
