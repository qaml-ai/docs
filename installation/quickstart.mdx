## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

<Note>
  Self-hosted requires an enterprise license. [Book a call with our sales team](https://cal.com/ipr-camelai/book-a-demo) to get started.
</Note>

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qaml-ai/camelAI-docker-compose.git
cd camelAI-docker-compose
```

### 2. AWS ECR Authentication

Since the camelAI image is stored in Amazon ECR, you'll need to authenticate Docker to access it:

1. Install the AWS CLI if you haven't already
2. Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Enter your:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region (us-west-2)
   - Default output format (json)

3. Authenticate Docker with ECR:
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 904534089871.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
   ```

4. Verify you have the necessary IAM permissions:
   - The `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` policy is required
   - Or a custom policy with `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` and `ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability` permissions

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

The repository includes a `.env.docker` template file. Copy it and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.docker .env.docker.local
```

Edit `.env.docker.local` with your configuration:
- Set a secure `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- Update `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with a secure password
- Configure your AWS credentials if using Bedrock
- Set up API keys if using OpenAI or Anthropic

See our [Environment Variables](/installation/environment-variables) guide for details.

### 4. Start the Application

Run the following command to start camelAI in production mode:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This will start the following services:
- `camel` – The main application
- `nginx` – Reverse proxy
- `pgvector` – PostgreSQL with vector extension
- `memcached` – Caching layer

### 5. Create a Superuser

Once the services are running, create your initial superuser account:

```bash
docker compose exec camel python manage.py createuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your superuser credentials.

### 6. Access the Web Interface

Visit the following URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Log in using the superuser credentials you just created.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. Check that Docker and Docker Compose are running
2. Verify your environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure you're authenticated with AWS ECR
4. Check the logs using:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```
