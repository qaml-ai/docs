## Prerequisites

Before creating a superuser, ensure that:

1. All services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. The database is properly initialized:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs db
   ```

## Creating the Superuser

### Using the Command Line

Run the following command to create a superuser:

```bash
docker compose exec camel python manage.py createuser
```

You'll be prompted to enter:
- Username
- Email address
- Password (and confirmation)

Example interaction:
```bash
Username: admin
Email address: admin@example.com
Password: ********
Password (again): ********
```

### Password Requirements

The password should meet the following requirements:
- At least 8 characters long
- Not too common
- Not entirely numeric
- Not similar to your username
- Not a commonly used password

## Verifying the Superuser

### Check User Creation

You can verify the superuser was created by checking the database:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U camel -d camel -c "SELECT username, email, is_superuser FROM auth_user;"
```

### Test Login

1. Visit the admin interface:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/admin/
   ```

2. Log in with your superuser credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check if the database service is running
   - Verify environment variables are correct
   - Check database logs:
     ```bash
     docker compose logs db
     ```

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure you have the correct permissions:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
     ```

3. **User Creation Fails**
   - Check application logs:
     ```bash
     docker compose logs camel
     ```

### Resetting Password

If you need to reset the superuser password:

```bash
docker compose exec camel python manage.py changepassword admin
```
