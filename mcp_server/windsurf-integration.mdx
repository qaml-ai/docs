description: 'Connect camelAI MCP server to Windsurf for seamless data analysis in your AI-powered code editor'
---

Integrate camelAI directly into Windsurf's Cascade to access powerful data analysis capabilities without leaving your development environment. Query your databases, generate insights, and get SQL results all within your AI-powered code editor.

<Note>
For the latest official guidance from Windsurf, refer to their Cascade MCP integration documentation: [Cascade MCP integration](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp).
</Note>

#### Step 1: Create MCP Configuration

Create or edit the MCP configuration file at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codeium/windsurf
touch ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Server

Add the following configuration to your `mcp_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "camelai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.camelai.com/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key from [app.camelai.com/api-keys](https://app.camelai.com/api-keys/).
</Warning>

#### Step 3: Refresh Plugins

After saving your configuration, press the refresh button in the Plugins section or restart Windsurf to load the new MCP server connection.

## Managing Tools

Windsurf has a limit of 100 total tools available to Cascade at any given time. You can manage which camelAI tools are enabled:

### Via Settings

Alternatively, go to `Windsurf Settings` > `Cascade` > `Plugins` and click the `Manage plugins` button to configure tool availability.

## Using camelAI in Windsurf

Once configured, camelAI tools will be automatically available in Windsurf's Cascade.

### Tool Execution

Windsurf's Cascade will automatically use camelAI tools when relevant to your queries. The AI will determine which tools to use based on the context of your conversation and requests.

<Note>
Enterprise users may need to manually enable MCP integration via settings before using MCP servers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server Not Connecting">
    **Symptoms:** camelAI tools don't appear in Windsurf's available tools

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your API key is correct
    - Check that `mcp_config.json` is in the correct location (`~/.codeium/windsurf/`)
    - Press the refresh button in the Plugins section
    - Restart Windsurf after configuration changes
    - Ensure you have internet connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    **Symptoms:** Tools appear but fail with authentication errors

    **Solutions:**
    - Generate a new API key at [app.camelai.com/api-keys](https://app.camelai.com/api-keys/)
    - Verify the API key is correctly set in the `env` section
    - Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Limit Reached">
    **Symptoms:** Some camelAI tools are not available

    **Solutions:**
    - Windsurf limits total tools to 100 across all MCP servers
    - Disable unused tools from other MCP plugins
    - Prioritize the most important camelAI tools for your workflow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="mcp-remote Installation Issues">
    **Symptoms:** Server fails to start with mcp-remote errors
