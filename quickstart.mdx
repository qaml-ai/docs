# ðŸš€ Quickstart Guide

Get camelAI up and running in minutes using Docker Compose. This guide will walk you through the installation process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qaml-ai/camelAI-docker-compose.git
cd camelAI-docker-compose
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

The repository includes a `.env.docker` template file. Copy it and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.docker .env.docker.local
```

Edit `.env.docker.local` with your configuration:
- Set a secure `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- Update `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with a secure password
- Configure your AWS credentials if using Bedrock
- Set up API keys if using OpenAI or Anthropic

See our [Environment Variables](/installation/environment-variables) guide for details.

### 3. Start the Application

Run the following command to start camelAI in production mode:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This will start the following services:
- `camel` â€“ The main application
- `nginx` â€“ Reverse proxy
- `pgvector` â€“ PostgreSQL with vector extension
- `memcached` â€“ Caching layer

### 4. Create a Superuser

Once the services are running, create your initial superuser account:

```bash
docker compose exec camel python manage.py createuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your superuser credentials.

### 5. Access the Web Interface

Visit the following URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Log in using the superuser credentials you just created.

## Next Steps

Now that you have camelAI running, you can:

1. [Connect your databases](/user-guide/databases)
2. [Start analyzing your data](/user-guide/analysis)
3. [Create custom reports](/user-guide/features/reports)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. Check that Docker and Docker Compose are running
2. Verify your environment variables are correctly set
3. Check the logs using:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```
