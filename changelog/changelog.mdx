    ### Enterprise User Permissions: Private Connections
    
    - Users can now create private connections only they can access, if the org-admin allows it
      - **This flag is on by default** and can be toggled at the User level in the Admin Panel.

    - At this time, non-admins can only add CSV and Excel files. The max file size for file upload is 1GB.
    - Non-admin users have the ability to edit and delete their own connections.
    - Data from a private connection cannot be shared. If an artifact with private data is added to a dashboard, that dashboard will be made private.
    - As an org-admin, you can add any private connection to a Group and that Group will have access to the data source. Please note, the owner of the connection will still have edit and delete access even if the connection is tied to a Group.
    
    ### User Experience Improvements
    
    - Added ability for users to give thumbs up to chat messages (will be used for query generation in a future release)
    - Added warning to contact owner for incomplete connection setup
    - Improved SAML group membership handling for better enterprise authentication
    
    ### BigQuery Improvements
    
    - Added support for date-sharded tables
    - Improved handling of large datasets
