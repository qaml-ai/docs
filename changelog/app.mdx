### Intelligent Memory Management with Full CRUD Operations

- **Expanded Memory Types:** Memory now stores SQL queries AND knowledge notes (text, business rules, definitions, processes)
- **Full CRUD Operations:**
  - Create new SQL queries and knowledge entries from conversations
  - Search existing memory to avoid duplicates
  - Delete outdated or incorrect AI-authored entries
- **Intelligent Agent-Driven Curation:** AI agent automatically identifies valuable insights from conversations and decides what to save or remove
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Automatically checks for similar entries before creating new ones
- **Permission Controls:** Only AI-authored entries can be deleted, protecting user-created knowledge

### Manual Artifact Refresh System

- Per-artifact manual refresh button with visual status indicators
- Shows "last updated" timestamp for each artifact
- Loading overlay with spinner during refresh operations
- Client-side polling to track refresh completion

### Minor Features

- **Clickhouse Connector Update:** Upgraded clickhouse-connect from 0.8.9 to 0.9.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Edit SQL Button Visibility:** Fixed issue where Edit SQL button didn't appear immediately for new artifacts - now shows edit controls right away when permissions allow
- **Navigation Flash Fix:** Eliminated the flash of open/close sidebar on page load by applying pre-render bootstrap state (#134)
- **Stale Connection IDs:** Fixed issue where disconnected data source IDs could be sent with new messages by validating and cleansing localStorage
- **Old Model Chat Loading:** Fixed issue preventing chats from loading when they used deprecated model versions - now falls back gracefully to available models
- **Magic Link URL Length:** Increased magic-link redirect URL storage limit from default to 2048 characters to prevent truncation of long redirect URLs
- **Longer Redis Lock:** Increased Redis lock timeout from 5 minutes to 20 minutes to prevent lock expiration during long-running operations

<img height="200" src="https://imagedelivery.net/0Ey8LwpQ4ATeP19F21mqig/3423d679-38ac-495a-a691-f804dda00400/public" />
- We now support OpenAI's O3 model alongside Claude 3.7
- Enter API keys for both models, and users will see a model switcher in the chat input field
- If you prefer to keep only Claude 3.7, that's perfectly fine - the switcher only appears when multiple model API keys are provided

### Updated Chat UI

  width="100%"
  height="400"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

- Redesigned chat interface to better separate camelAI's "work" from its "final answer"
- The UI no longer auto-collapses the AI's thought process, making it easier to track what camel is doing

### Python Capabilities

### Minor Features

- **Artifacts of Delete Data Sources** â€“ A warning message now appears on artifacts when one or more data sources used have been deleted

  - For enterprise users, soft-deleted connections are only visible in Django admin where you can hard delete if needed

- **New Integrations** â€“ Azure data source support (Enterprise only)

### Bug Fixes

<Update label="April 14, 2025" description="Version 0.1.x">
<Warning>
  This update includes changes to user permissions. Enterprise administrators should review permission settings after upgrading.
</Warning>

### Reference Queries & Knowledge Base Enhancement

- Added support for many-to-many relationships for reference queries and knowledge base items **(Django Admin Dashboard only)**
<img height="200" src="https://imagedelivery.net/0Ey8LwpQ4ATeP19F21mqig/ca28fb2c-84da-416e-438d-867ff5318100/public" />
- Added visual tags in UI to identify reference queries and knowledge base items used across multiple data sources
<img height="200" src="https://imagedelivery.net/0Ey8LwpQ4ATeP19F21mqig/36578466-38df-4325-3de2-8eadc49cf900/public" />

### Enterprise User Permissions: Private Connections

- Users can now create private connections only they can access, if the org-admin allows it
  - **This flag is on by default** and can be toggled at the User level in the Admin Panel.
<img height="200" src="https://imagedelivery.net/0Ey8LwpQ4ATeP19F21mqig/3ff773d2-ee13-43fe-127a-934471fe9500/public" />
- At this time, non-admins can only add CSV and Excel files. The max file size for file upload is 1GB.
- Non-admin users have the ability to edit and delete their own connections.
- Data from a private connection cannot be shared. If an artifact with private data is added to a dashboard, that dashboard will be made private.
- As an org-admin, you can add any private connection to a Group and that Group will have access to the data source. Please note, the owner of the connection will still have edit and delete access even if the connection is tied to a Group.
