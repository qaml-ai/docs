**Notes:**

¹ **Group Sharing Restrictions**: Owner can only share dashboards with groups if:
   - The owner is a member of the group
   - The group has access to all data sources used by artifacts in the dashboard

² **External Sharing Restrictions**: External sharing is only possible if:
   - The owner belongs to a group with external sharing enabled (`can_share_externally=true`)
   - All artifacts in the dashboard use data sources from groups with external sharing enabled

³ **Data Source Access**: Users can only access data sources through chat that are connected to groups they belong to

⁴ **Chat with Artifact**: The "Start a chat" button on dashboard artifacts is only available to users who have access to the underlying data source through their group membership

⁵ **Private Connections**: Non-admin users can create private connections (currently limited to CSV and Excel files up to 1GB) if enabled by an org-admin. This feature is enabled by default per user.

⁶ **Private Connection Sharing**: Data from private connections cannot be shared with other users. If an artifact with private data is added to a dashboard, that dashboard becomes private and only visible to the creator. Only org-admins can share private connection data by adding the connection to a group.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dashboard Sharing Rules

### Conditions for Sharing with Groups (Enterprise Tier)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Group Data Source Access">
    The group must have access to all data sources used by all artifacts in the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Group Membership">
    The user attempting to access must be a member of all required groups
  </Step>
  <Step title="Private Connection Limitations">
    Dashboards containing artifacts that use private connections cannot be shared unless an org-admin has added those private connections to a group
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conditions for External Sharing

<Warning>
  External sharing permissions are carefully controlled to protect sensitive data.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Owner Permissions">
    The dashboard owner must be in a group with external sharing enabled
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Source Permissions">
    All artifacts in the dashboard must use data sources from groups that allow external sharing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Changes in Conditions">
    If any condition changes (e.g., artifact added using a restricted data source), external access should be revoked
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access Revocation

Access is automatically removed when:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Removed from Group">
    A user is removed from a group required to access a dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Source Removed from Group">
    A data source is removed from a group and dashboards using that data source are shared with the group
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External Sharing Settings Changed">
    External sharing settings for a group are changed, affecting dashboards with artifacts using data sources from that group
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Private Connection Added to Dashboard">
    A user adds an artifact using a private connection to a previously shared dashboard, causing the dashboard to become private until an org-admin adds the private connection to the relevant groups
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Private Connection Removed from Group">
    An org-admin removes a private connection from a group, restricting access to dashboards containing artifacts using that connection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
